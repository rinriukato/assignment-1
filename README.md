# Assignment 1 - Git, Github and TypeScript Starter Code

See assignment on the [course website](https://cs-ucf.github.io/CEN-5016-S24/assignments/assignment-1)

The starter code is a basic express server with an endpoint that computes fibonacci(n)

## Running the App

The steps below aren't strictly necessary to complete the assignment, but will help you to run the app.

1. Make sure you have TypeScript and npm installed
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the server
4. Go to a browser and visit `localhost:3000/fib/n` to see the result for fibonacci(n)

## Running tests and linter

We've setup a GitHub action to run eslint and tests for the fibonacci endpoint.

- You can run the linter locally by running `npm run lint`
- You can run the tests defined in `tests/fib.test.ts` by running `npm run test`
